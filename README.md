# Web-Hosted Guide Chatbot for Museum

This project presents a prototype of a web-hosted guide chatbot for the Museo Nacional de Antropolog√≠a in Mexico City, developed using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach and a LLaMA language model. Due to the large size of the museum dataset, it was not included in the repository. To run the project locally, a LLaMA model must be installed on your computer. The `backend.py` file launches a Flask server that enables local testing of the RAG model. The `inicio` folder contains all the images and HTML files necessary to build the website interface for the chatbot.
